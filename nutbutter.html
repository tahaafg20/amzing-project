 <h3> Black Sesame Almond Butter</h3>
 <p>Lightly roasted almonds and black sesame stone-ground into a rich flavourful butter.You'll be spreading this like there's no tomorrow once we tell you that Black Sesame is believed to have anti-ageing properties thanks to its rich sources of Vitamin-B and Iron. No palm oil and no salt - just pure goodness. Feel good with every mouthful (it's not too good to be true!)</p>

 <h3>All Natural Almond Butter</h3>
 <p>Pure almonds lightly roasted and stone-ground into a silky-smooth butter. That’s it – no added salt, sugar, or oil! Allow the natural toastiness of almonds to give your food a boost of flavour and nutrition. Spread it on toast, swirl it into oatmeal, or use it as a substitute for butter in baked goods!</p>

 <h3>Chocolate Coconut Hazelnut Butter</h3>
 <p>A divine blend of earthy hazelnut butter and all the chocolatey goodness of dark cocoa powder, with chewy toasted coconut bits mixed in. The best part? Still healthy, with no added salt, refined sugar, or oil! Need we say more? Amazing as a spread, a dip for fresh fruit, or as a decadent topping for ice cream (shh..we won’t tell!).</p>
